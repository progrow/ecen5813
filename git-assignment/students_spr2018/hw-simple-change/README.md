**Adding yourself to the favorite file**

**Steps**

1) Modify the favorites.json file in this folder (hw_simple_change). You will need to add a unique username key and your favorite movie, tv/theater show, and video/board game. When you add a new line, put a comma on the previous line before adding to the bottom. See example below.

  *format:*
  ```
  "identikey_username": {
      "movie": "favorite movie name",
      "show": "favorite show name",
      "game": "favorite game name"
  }
  ```
  *example:*
  ```
  "afosdick": {
      "movie": "Inception",
      "show": "Bob's Burgers",
      "game": "Final Fantasy 8"
  },
  "tparker": {
      "movie": "Team America",
      "show": "South Park",
      "game": "The Stick of Truth"
  }
  ```
2) No git merge commands may be used. All merging needs to be done with git rebase and conflict resolution.
